# Unity environment eliciting prediction error brain responses in an interactive reach-to-touch VR scenario.

Two haptic feedback channels were provided to the user, the resources are in this repository:
- a vibrotactile motor was controlled via Arduino
- electrical muscle stimulation (on the forearm) was provided using Hasomed Rehastim

LSL4Unity was used to send experiment event markers as well as motion capture from the HTC Vive Headset as well as one Tracker puck (mounted on the back of the hand) to a recording machine simultaneously sampling EEG (Electroencephalography) signals.

Recorded data as well as data processing and paper source files are available on [OSF](https://osf.io/x7hnm/)
